# PMIS_Project_Planning

## Overview
This project simulates the complete planning process for a real-world construction project using Project Management Information System (PMIS) methodology. The aim is to apply theoretical project management knowledge into practice by building a comprehensive project plan including scope, schedule, cost, risk, and stakeholder components.

## Objectives

- Develop a Gantt chart with task dependencies, critical path, and milestone tracking  
- Estimate project budget and resource allocations using bottom-up costing  
- Identify potential risks and mitigation plans with a structured Risk Register  
- Map stakeholder influence and communication strategy for engagement throughout the project lifecycle

## Key Outcomes
- Delivered a complete project plan with over 70 detailed tasks and 10+ milestones  
- Created a risk matrix identifying 15+ potential risks with mitigation strategies  
- Established a detailed cost breakdown and project budgeting across phases  
- Demonstrated practical understanding of project management best practices following PMBOK guidelines

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Gantt Chart, Costing, Risk Register)  
- Draw.io (WBS diagrams, Risk Matrix)  
- Google Docs / Slides (Documentation and Presentation)
- Power BI
- SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) / VScode
